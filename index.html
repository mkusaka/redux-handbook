It is often used in combination with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a> to pull state out from the view layer into a single store. In simple terms, any data that may change ends up living in Redux, which then gets wired up to your React containers to provide the means to <strong>read</strong> from or <strong>write</strong> to your state object.</p><p>When using Redux, your implementation typically focuses on one of three areas:</p><ul><li>Actions, which describe both the type and any relevant data that you use to communicate updates to the store,
</li>
<li>Reducers, which is the code that actually performs the update to the store based on the Actions,
</li>
<li>Containers, which is the &quot;glue&quot; that binds Redux to your components using <a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750#.jxumv6uhb" target="_blank">higher order components</a>. Your containers provide the means to interact with Redux by allowing you to wire up state properties or action creators that your components receive as props.
</li></ul>
<p>If you are new to Redux, the <a href="http://redux.js.org/index.html" target="_blank">docs</a> are an excellent place to start.</p><h3 id="why-we-use-it">Why We Use It</h3><p>Redux is an evolution of the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html" target="_blank">Flux</a> architecture and has similar goals, namely pulling application state out of the view layer and providing the means to interact with it. There are a few key differences between the two, such as:</p><ul><li>Flux often advocates for multiple stores, whereas Redux has a single store and uses &quot;reducer&quot; functions to allow for a separation of concerns.
</li>
<li>Flux is an &quot;architecture&quot; with several implementations; Redux is a single library.
</li>
<li>Flux allows for either mutable or immutable data (although immutability is often encouraged); Redux mandates immutability.
</li></ul>
<p>The combination of these points leads to several advantages with Redux.</p><ul><li>You don&apos;t have to worry about multiple stores and managing any dependencies between them.
</li>
<li>Immutability being mandatory means Redux is able to implement <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/advanced-performance.html" target="_blank">shouldComponentUpdate</a> optimization for free.
</li>
<li>The single store and immutable data allows for easy implementation of features such as simpler state hydration, snapshots, or recording/&quot;time travel&quot;.
</li>
<li>Redux&apos;s approach allows it to have a smaller, simpler API making it easier to learn and use in practice.
</li>
<li>This also allows for easier testing and debugging.
</li>
<li>It has become very popular leading to quick adoption and community support through additional modules/middleware.
</li></ul>
<h3 id="are-there-downsides-to-using-redux">Are There Downsides to Using Redux?</h3><p>There is an excellent discussion on <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1385" target="_blank">github</a> about this. An additional thing to consider is that your data should be represented in your state object in a normalized way. This may take more consideration depending on your data model/API design. Dan Abramov has provided another tool called <a href="https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr" target="_blank">normalizr</a>, which attempts to address this.</p>
